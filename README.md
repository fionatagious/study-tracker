# StudyTracker

## Project Overview
Habit trackers abound in the stationery and planning world. In the absence of purchasing Moleskines, washi tapes, and Mildliners, I've created a stationery-inspired study stopwatch and tracker ⏲️ 📔 to record past coding sessions with friends, teammates, and mentors.
